            <h2>Hytale</h2>
            <p>
                Hytale has not officially released yet, as of writing. The game began development 
                in 2015 and entered a state of early access January 13th, 2026. Even though this 
                game is not yet released, it is included here because the early access is very 
                well polished, the game comes from a great background, and the community is very 
                supportive and active. Basically, the game has a great potential and is already fun.

                Hytale is a game long awaited by many Minecraft players. To understand the story behind Hytale, 
                it might be best to start with understanding what Hypixel is. Hypixel is Minecraft's #1 online
                server. It isn't affiliated with Minecraft officially, but at all times has over 15,000 players 
                online. (As of the time of writing this, there are 33,000+ currently online) It's a pretty big 
                deal compared to any other server. The server itself is a hub for many different mini-games, 
                building plots, and pvp-games. Fun fact: Hypixel started out showcasing and hosting adventure 
                maps where players go on a mini adventure and solve puzzles. The adventure maps are still 
                available to download, but aren't on the server anymore. Anyways, enough about Hypixel, let's 
                talk about their game.<br>
                Hytale has been in development since 2015 and has had quite an adventure in getting to where 
                it is today. The game was acquired by Riot Games in 2020 where it was rewritten in C++ as a 
                cross-platform game. After spending tons of time, effort, and money, Riot Games decided to 
                shut the project down. Dissapointing, but it's Riot Games, we're used to dissapointment from 
                these guys. In 2025 Hypixel Studios re-purchased their game to bring it back to life, starting 
                by reverting to the original Java/C#-based game engine. Shortly after the re-purchase, Hytale 
                was already in a state ready to release in early-access, and that it did. While the game 
                currently remains incomplete, there is plenty already implemented.<br>
                <img loading="lazy" src="./images/hytale/hytale-character.webp" alt="Hytale character customizer" id="cust-char-image">
                The game already includes: a very satisfying character customizer, a classic survival mode, 
                a creative mode for more in-depth building or content creation, enemies to fight, gear to craft 
                ores to mine, and a placeholder for a minigames mode. Players can play multiplayer with friends 
                already, too. There are plenty of online dedicated servers to check out if you don't want to 
                just play locally.<br>

                One of the coolest features, in my opinion, is the mods. The game includes tools to create assets 
                for the game and tries to make it as accessable as possible for anyone to start creating. Even 
                cooler than that, players can join your modded world without having to download a thing! It 
                works super seamlessly and is very exciting for players who like to load up their worlds with 
                mods, but don't want walk others through setting up their games the same way.<br>
